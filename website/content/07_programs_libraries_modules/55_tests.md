Tests are a cornerstone of a solid Python program. Thankfully, because of Python's "batteries included" philosophy, all the tools we need for unit testing are included in the standard library. Let's learn the basics of Unit Testing.

Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual functions are tested in an automated fashion to determine if they are fit for use. Automated unit testing not only helps you discover and fix bugs quicker and easier than if you weren't testing, but by writing them alongside or even *before* your functions, they can help you write cleaner and more bug-free code from the very start.


### Types of Tests

There are several different kinds of automated tests that can be performed at different abstraction levels.

* Unit tests operate on the smallest testable unit of code, usually a function that performs a single action or operation.
* Integration tests check to see if different units or modules of code work together as a group.
* Functional tests operate on units of functionality, to make sure a specific function of the software is working, which may involve several units of software or whole systems working together.

For this class, we'll just be focusing on unit tests.


### Tests in the Real Worldâ„¢

How is this helpful in the real world? Many companies that invest in software development maintain a CI/CD (Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment) pipeline. This usually involves extensive unit tests, integration tests, and maybe even functional tests, which are set up to run automatically after (and sometimes even *before*) code is committed. If the tests fail, deployment can be stopped and the developers get notified before broken code ever makes it to production servers. This can be complicated to set up properly, but saves an enormous amount of time in the long run, and helps to keep bugs from ever reaching your users.



Python comes with a handy-dandy `assert` keyword that you can use for simple sanity checks. An assertion is simply a boolean expression that checks if its conditions return true or not. If the assertion is true, the program continues. If it's false, it throws an `AssertionError`, and your program will stop. Assertions are also a great debugging tool, as they can stop your program in exactly the spot where an error has occurred. This is great for rooting out unreliable data or faulty assumptions.

To make an assertion, just use the `assert` keyword followed by a condition that should be `True`:

```python
>>> input_value = 25
>>> assert input_value > 0
```

If our assertion fails, however:

```python
>>> input_value = 25
>>> assert input_value > 100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
```

### `assert` Is For Sanity Checks, Not For Production!

Assertions are great for simple self-checks and sanity tests. You shouldn't, however, use assertions for failure cases that can occur because of bad user input or operating system/environment failures, such as a file not being found. These situations are much better suited to an exception or an error message.

{{% notice warning %}}
Assertions can be disabled at run time, by starting the program with `python -O`, so you shouldn't rely on assertions to run in production code. Don't use them for validation!

## Writing Your Tests


There are a few different frameworks for writing unit tests in Python, but they're all very similar. We'll focus on the built-in `unittest` library. `unittest` is both a framework for writing tests, as well as a test runner, meaning it can execute your tests and return the results. In order to write `unittest` tests, you must:

* Write your tests as methods within classes
* Use a series of built-in assertion methods

Let's start with a simple function to test, `multiply()`, which takes two numbers and multiplies them.

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
```

Easy enough. Let's write a test case for it. Usually this will be broken out into separate files, but we'll combine them for this contrived example. We'll create a `TestMultiply` class that derives from `unittest.TestCase`, with a method inside that does the actual testing. Lastly, we'll call `unittest.main()` to tell `unittest` to find and run our TestCase. We'll put all this in a file called `test_multiply.py` and run it from the command line:

```python
# test_multiply.py

import unittest

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

class TestMultiply(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_multiply(self):
        test_x = 5
        test_y = 10
        self.assertEqual(multiply(test_x, test_y), 50, "Should be 50")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

```bash
(env) $ python test_multiply.py
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

### Failing Tests

Let's introduce a bug into our `multiply()` function and see what happens when we run the test:

```python
# test_multiply.py

import unittest

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * x

class TestMultiply(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_multiply(self):
        test_x = 5
        test_y = 10
        self.assertEqual(multiply(test_x, test_y), 50, "Should be 50")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

```bash
(env) $ python test_multiply.py
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_multiply (__main__.TestMultiply)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_multiply.py", line 11, in test_multiply
    self.assertEqual(multiply(test_x, test_y), 50, "Should be 50")
AssertionError: 25 != 50 : Should be 50

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1)
```

### Important Concepts

* `TestCase` class must subclass `unittest.TestCase`
* Names of test functions must begin with `test_`
* Import the code to be tested

Your `TestCase` class can be called whatever you want, but you must subclass `unittest.TestCase` in order for it to work.

{{% notice info %}}
Your test functions in your TestCase must begin with `test_`, otherwise they won't be run as tests.
{{% /notice %}}

This can be useful if you need to include utility functions inside your TestCase.

Lastly, your test code will need access to your code to be tested. For a small project, this is easily done by putting your tests in a `test.py` file alongside your code. For larger projects, you usually want to have multiple test files inside a `test` folder. In this case, you'll need to make sure your code to be tested is available on your `PYTHONPATH`.

### Running your Tests

As we saw, one common way of running your tests is by calling `unittest.main()`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Add this to your test file, run it, and you're off to the races. You can also skip this bit, and call `unittest` directly from the command line:

```bash
(env) $ python -m unittest test_module
```

Here, you don't need to make your test file runnable (by using `unittest.main()`), instead you're running `unittest` directly and telling it where to find your tests.

{{% notice tip %}}
Use the `-v` (or `--verbose`) flag can give you more information about which tests were run
{{% /notice %}}


```bash
(env) $ python -m unittest test_multiply -v
test_multiply (test_multiply.TestMultiply) ... FAIL

======================================================================
FAIL: test_multiply (test_multiply.TestMultiply)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/nina/Desktop/test_multiply.py", line 11, in test_multiply
    self.assertEqual(multiply(test_x, test_y), 50, "Should be 50")
AssertionError: 25 != 50 : Should be 50

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1)
```


### TestCase Assertions

Subclassing the TestCase class gives you a bunch of useful assertions that you can use to check the validity of your code. Here's the list from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html):


|Method|Checks that|
|---|---|
|assertEqual(a, b)|a == b|
|assertNotEqual(a, b)|a != b|
|assertTrue(x)|bool(x) is True|
|assertFalse(x)|bool(x) is False|
|assertIs(a, b)|a is b|
|assertIsNot(a, b)|a is not b|
|assertIsNone(x)|x is None|
|assertIsNotNone(x)|x is not None|
|assertIn(a, b)|a in b|
|assertNotIn(a, b)|a not in b|
|assertIsInstance(a, b)|isinstance(a, b)|
|assertNotIsInstance(a, b)|not isinstance(a, b)|


### Growing your Tests

Standard `unittest` tests are fine for most projects. As your programs grow and organization becomes more complex, you might want to consider an alternative testing framework or test runner. The 3rd party `nose2` and `pytest` modules are compatible with `unittest` but do things slightly differently. You can find more information in the [nose2 documentation](https://nose2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
