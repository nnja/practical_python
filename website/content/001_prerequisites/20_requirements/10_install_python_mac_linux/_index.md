For this course, you'll be using the latest stable version of Python available, which is currently Python 3.9.


{{% notice note %}}
We'll be using VS Code throughout the class to provide a consistent experience for all students. Once the course is over, feel free to go back to the editor of your choice to continue on your Python adventure.

If you're used to keybindings in a different editor, you can set up a [keymaps extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keymap-extensions) in VS Code to match what you're used to.

### Making sure you're ready

To make sure you have all the prerequisites properly installed:

#### Check for Python 3.9

Type the following on your terminal.
```bash
$ python3 --version
```

You should see something like
```bash
Python 3.9.0
```

{{% notice info %}}
If you don't see a Python version greater than 3.9, please follow the instructions for [installing Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) again.

### Creating a Virtual Environment and The Project Folder

A Virtual Environment in Python is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python.

It's a very useful way to make sure that we're using the right Python version when we're working on a particular project.

Let's create a project directory and a Python 3.9 Virtual Environment.

Open a terminal window. Type the following.

(Do not type the `$` character, that signifies a prompt.)

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir pyworkshop
$ cd pyworkshop
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

{{% notice tip %}}
`source env/bin/activate` is how you *activate* your virtual environment on Mac or Linux. You'll want to do that each time you enter this Python project directory from a new shell.
{{% /notice %}}

Your prompt should look like this to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

```bash
(env) $
```

#### Upgrade pip

Upgrade pip, the Python package installer to the latest version.

```bash
(env) $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Troubleshooting

{{% notice warning %}}
You are expected to work from this project folder for the duration of the class, with an activated virtual environment.
{{% /notice %}}

If something is not working, please make sure that you're in the correct project directory with an activated virtual environment.

### Checking VS Code

Look for VS Code in your Applications, or type the following in your terminal.

```bash
$ code --version
```

You should see something like:

```text
1.49.0
e790b931385d72cf5669fcefc51cdf65990efa5d
x64
```

### Installing `code` on your Path

If typing `code` in your terminal doesn't work, you may need to follow the instructions to install it on your path, [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
