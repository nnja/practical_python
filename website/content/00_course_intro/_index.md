# Practical Python

### What You'll Need to Know

This course is targeted at advanced beginner / intermediate developers.

Ideally, you already know how to program in a different programming language and want to ramp up with reading and writing Python programs as quickly as possible.

You'll need to have the following skills to get the most out of the course: 

- Command line experience in any operating system.
- Coding experience in any language, as well as an understanding of concepts like like types, functions, and loops.
- An understanding of the basics behind working with APIs -- requests, responses, and HTTP status codes.

If you're not comfortable with the skills above, consider trying my two-day course instead that focuses on quickly and productively ramping up beginner developers with Python. Start with [Python Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/python/), and followed by [Intermediate Python](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-python/).

To get the most out of the course, follow the installation instructions for Python 3.9 and Visual Studio Code.
