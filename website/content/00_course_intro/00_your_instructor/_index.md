{{< figure src="/images/headshot.jpg?width=20pc" width="30%" title="Nina Zakharenko" >}}

Hi, I’m Nina Zakharenko.

I’m an expert developer with over a decade of experience and a passion for speaking and teaching. I've been involved in the Python community for over 7 years and in the past I've written code for companies like Reddit, Meetup, and HBO. I currently focus on Python at Microsoft as a Principal Cloud Developer Advocate. In 2020 I was elected to the Board of Directors for the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

I've [spoken at Python conferences around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AYIe-3cD-s&list=PLU2JOyCJmabDwN3KYNaxwhl9ZyA3E3PP9), including PyCon US, PyParis, PyCon Australia, PyCon Russia, and I'm co-organizer of PyCascades Remote 2021. In my spare time I enjoy hiking and tinkering with hardware and wearable electronics. 

You might notice I change my hair color frequently!
